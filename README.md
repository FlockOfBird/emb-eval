<h1>SentEval+</h1>
<p>We are introducing SentEval+. A framework built based on SentEval framework to both generate and evaluate embeddings.</p>
<h2>Where To Start</h2>
<p>You can download the embeddings of x,y,z,... datasets from this table. If you need to add new dataset to evaluate:
  <li> 1) Want to test our provided embeddings? follow <a href='ee'>these</a> steps.  </li>
  <li> 2) Want to start from scratch? steps to generate embeddings using our code </li>
  <li> 3) Already have the embeddings of your dataset? put your csv file in the target directory with following format: csv structure + filename rules </li>
</p>
